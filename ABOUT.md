# Hackulele

I was bored abroad and missed my ukulele to just occupy my hands. Turned out some other dude was selling one of his [Populele](https://popuband.com/products/populele-with-accessory) for pretty cheap, so I bought it to have a travel uke, and also because OMG BLINKING LIGHTS. 

## Unboxing

Haha. No.

## Playing

You can make pleasant noises with it. Just train for a couple years or more.

## App

The point of the whole thing is you're supposed to use bloated ugly and slow ass app to connect to your uke over bluetooth, so it can send it commands to light the blinky lights.

After you go through the unskippable "tutorial" that will drive everybody crazy, it can shows you chords, you can 'draw', and other things.

It tries to gamify the learning process, has songbooks and stuff. 

As all "SMART" things go, everybody on the [app's page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gt.populeleinternational&hl=en&showAllReviews=true) complains about shitty bluetooth connection, bugs, etc. The whole thing is just absolutely frustrating to use and barely works as expected. Also probably comes with free remote management of your Android device ¯\\\_(?)\_/¯

# Hacking

Okay here are the fun parts. The SMARTness of the thing is hidden in the easily unscrewable brown plastic part on the side of the instruments. Reveals a boardy board, a lipo-y lipo, and cabley cables to connect to the blinky blink side.
