# Hackulele

OpenSource library to talk to a [Populele](https://popuband.com/products/populele-with-accessory)'s Led matrix


## Install

The code should currently work on any board that can run Adafruit's [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io).

I use the [Feather M0 Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995), for later BLE dev (maybe).

Just copy `main.py` over to your mounted board's filesystem.
