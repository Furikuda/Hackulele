# Hackulele

OpenSource library to talk to a [Populele](https://popuband.com/products/populele-with-accessory)'s Led matrix

If you're interested about the story behind the project, and how this came up, I have [another doc](ABOUT.md) for you.

## Install

The code should currently work on any board that can run Adafruit's [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io).

I use the [Feather M0 Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995), for later BLE dev (maybe).
This one is nice because it has the battery charging circuit (so I can keep everyhing inside the instrument) as well as BLE for later things.

Just copy `main.py` over to your mounted board's filesystem.

## Connect

This is a bit trickier. Once you disconnected everything from your Uke, you'll be left with a JST-style connector.
When looking at it you get the following pins:


```
          ___      ___
    _____|   |____|   |______
   |                         |
   |    5V     GND     SCL   |
   |                         |
   |    SDB    INT     SDA   |
   |_________________________|

```

Connect SCL/SDA/5V/GND to the same pins on your microcontroller board (5V is the one directly connected to USB). 

Then put INT to GND, and SDB to pin D10.

Also remember SCL & SDA need to be Pull'ed UP, so connect them to 5V via a 4.7K resistor for each line.

Stuff everything back into the ukulele and you should be good to go.
